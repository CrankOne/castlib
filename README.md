# The CastLib Package

The package is designed for automated synchronization of medium-scale data
among multiple storaging filesystem-like back-ends in a recursive manner with
clear and highly configurable behaviour.

Historically its main purpose was to provide the centralized and managable
approach for synchronization of the experimental data statistics acquired
by NA64 experiment on SPS (CERN, Geneva, 2015 - nowadys).

The major targeting back-end is the CERN Advanced STORage manager
([CASTOR](http://castor.web.cern.ch/)), the service offering hierarchical
management system for high-persistent data.
